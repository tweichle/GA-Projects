### General Assembly Data Science Course Projects using Python

This repository contains a series of projects that were completed in order to practice and apply the skills covered in-class.

**Unit Projects**

At the end of each Unit, we worked on short structured projects. These activities tested our understanding of the unit’s most important concepts with in-class practice and instructor support.

**Final Project**

We also completed a final project, which asked us to apply our skills to a real-world or business problem of our choice.

The capstone was an opportunity for us to demonstrate our new skills and tackled a pressing issue relevant to our life, industry, or organization. 
We created a hypothesis, analyzed internal data, and generated a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

Final project deliverables included:

- Proposal: Describe the chosen problem and identify relevant data sets (confirming access, as needed).<br>
- Brief: Share a summary of the initial analysis and next steps with the instructional team.<br>
- Report: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter Notebook (or other files) documenting the code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.<br>
- Presentation: Present a summary of the business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.<br>
